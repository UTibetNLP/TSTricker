## Introduction

We divided our work in the paper below into two parts.

***Multi-Granularity Tibetan Textual Adversarial Attack Method Based on Masked Language Model (Cao et al., WWW 2024 Workshop - SocialNLP)***

One of them is the fine-tuning part which is open-sourced on [https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanPLMsFineTuning](https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanPLMsFineTuning).

The other one is the attacker part which is open-sourced on [https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanAdversarialAttack](https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanAdversarialAttack).
